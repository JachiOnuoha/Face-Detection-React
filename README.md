This web app uses the Face API from Azure Cognitive Services to identify faces ( and attributes such as emotion and age) in images.
The web app is designed as a quickstart guide so all you'll need to do is get your API Key and Endpoint

# Getting API Key and Endpoint
1. Create or Login into Azure Portal
  - Azure Portal: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/  
2. Create Face resource in Azure Portal to gain API Key and Endpoint

# Other resources
- Azure Cognitive Services: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/#api

Feel free to let me know if there are issues and I'd love to see any improvements or changes you make!
Happy Coding!
